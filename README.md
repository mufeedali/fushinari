### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on some Linux utility software that are intended to be intuitive and familiar for even users coming from other platforms. For example, [Wordbook](https://github.com/fushinari/wordbook) was made as an alternative to [WordWeb](https://wordweb.info/) on Windows. I'm also one of the maintainers of [Dialect](https://github.com/dialect-app/dialect).

I'm a Linux lover. I have two Fedora installations, one with Plasma and the other with GNOME. Everything I make is usually specifically for Linux and I hope to keep it that way.

If you'd like to help me out, please consider donating. It would be much appreciated and would help me out a lot.
